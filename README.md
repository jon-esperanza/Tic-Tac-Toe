# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game written in Java, has a menu with two options. Either play against CPU or with a friend.
This project allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of 2d arrays, methods, for/while loops, and manipulating user input. I also enjoyed adding random generated functionality to play against the CPU.
